# Real-Time Collaborative Chat

A real-time chat application utilizing **Socket.io** for real-time communication, **Node.js** as the server runtime, and **HTML/JavaScript** for the front-end.

## Features
- **Real-time messaging**: Seamlessly send and receive messages across multiple users.
- **Socket.io integration**: WebSocket-based communication for efficient message broadcasting.
- **Frontend**: Simple, responsive UI built with vanilla HTML and JavaScript.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed.
### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tamarkilasonia/Real-time-Collaborative-Whiteboard.git
cd Real-time-Collaborative-Whiteboard

Install dependencies:npm install
Run the server:npm start

How It Works
The server uses Socket.io to listen for incoming messages and broadcast them to all connected clients in real-time.
The client-side JavaScript listens for message events and dynamically updates the UI.
